# Email Service API

## Overview

This Flask application provides a simple API for sending emails. It utilizes Flask-Mail for email functionality and Flask-Restful for creating a RESTful API. Swagger is integrated for API documentation.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-Mail Flask-Restful Flask-Swagger
```

Make sure to set the environment variable `MAIL_PASSWORD` with the email account password.

## Configuration

The application is configured to use a Gmail SMTP server for sending emails. You can modify the email settings in the code:

```python
app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = 'smtp.gmail.com'
app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = 587
app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS'] = True
app.config['MAIL_USE_SSL'] = False
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = 'your_email@gmail.com'
app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = os.environ.get('MAIL_PASSWORD')
app.config['MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER'] = 'your_email@gmail.com'
```

## API Endpoint

- **Endpoint URL:** `/send_email`
- **HTTP Method:** POST

## Request

The `/send_email` endpoint expects the following parameters in the form data:

1. **subject** (type: string, required): The subject of the email.
2. **recipient** (type: string, required): The email address of the recipient.
3. **body** (type: string, required): The body content of the email.

## Responses

- **200 OK:** Email sent successfully.
- **400 Bad Request:** Missing required fields.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** An error occurred during the email sending process.

## How to Run

Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python your_file_name.py
```

The application will run on `http://localhost:5000/`. You can use tools like cURL or Postman to interact with the API.

## Example

### cURL Command

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/send_email -F "subject=Hello" -F "recipient=example@email.com" -F "body=This is a test email."
```

For more details, refer to the API documentation generated by Swagger.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the error responses and consult the Flask, Flask-Mail, and Flask-Restful documentation for troubleshooting tips.
